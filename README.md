# Branding

Add some bling to your terminal. Branding has 1 dependency and is less than 300 lines of code.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'branding'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## How it works

Branding will detect your Rails application's favicon. It adds a small
initializer in development and testing environments that draws the favicon with
ANSI control characters.

## Usage

Continue your normal workflow.
